# Attention Quantifier
 mathematical model demo for attention quantification in VR.The project already contains the packages needed to run directly on a Meta Quest 2 helmet.
The demo scene can be found in the "/Assets/Scenes" folder. In it we've placed 3 3D objects tracked by our mathematical model. Attention scores, instantaneous scores and the average attention given to each object are visible above each object. To this we add the time spent looking at the object and the number of times the object has been crossed. All these scores are updated in real time.
The model behavior code can be accessed in /Assets/Scripts/VisionTracker
